The setup_first_tests is based on these questions:


## 1 - Communities and clusters:
- What communities can be discovered using Twitter within NL?
- What relationship can be found between the specific structure of communities and network-metrics?

## 2 - Profiling:
- Which methods can be used for profiling/entity resolution with this data, and what results to they give?
- What key-nodes can be discovered? Are these persons, organisations, companies, etc.?

## 3 - Information-flow , topics + sentiment::
- What can be said about the relationship of network-structure and information-flow? Does this differ from other research in a related field?
- What topics can be discovered? How do these relate to 
1) the according sentiment, and 
2) the propagation of the respective Tweets?
- What is the proportion of key-nodes that broadcast content actually a newsmedia-related user, and what proportion are
persons, companies, etc.?
- Using these metrics and having a sense of propagation, can anything preliminary be said about influential nodes and 
their broadcasted content?
- Is it possible to predict sentiment, and even big social events? Can this be tested with upcoming events?


## 4 - In general:

(Lise Getoor)
But big data is not flat; it is richly structured, multi-relational, with many interesting links [...] flattening data to insert 
it into a conventional matrix does not work. “We need a data science for graphs,” 
Key things to keep in mind include: constructing features that allow us to extract more information from a graph; and collective reasoning, the ability to use local information on a network so we can infer missing labels.
