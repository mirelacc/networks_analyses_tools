- What communities can be discovered using Twitter within NL?
- Which methods can be used for profiling/entity resolution with this data, and what results to they give?
- What can be said about the relationship of network-structure and information-flow? Does this differ from other research 
in a related field?
- What key-nodes can be discovered? Are these persons, organisations, companies, etc.?
- What topics can be discovered? How do these relate to 
1) the according sentiment, and 
2) the propagation of the respective Tweets?
- What is the proportion of key-nodes that broadcast content actually a newsmedia-related user, and what proportion are
persons, companies, etc.?
- Using these metrics and having a sense of propagation, can anything preliminary be said about influential nodes and 
their broadcasted content?
- Is it possible to predict sentiment, and even big social events? Can this be tested with upcoming events?


## 1 - Discovering communities / populations / clusters

Overlapping & non-overlapping clusters/communities

K-clique algorithm:
(+ mixed-membership stochastic block models, Airoldi et al. -> prodability distribution
of community memberships, for every pair of communities you know the 
background linking probability for that pair)

Discovering communities:
1 - take dataset, 2 - represent as graph, 3 - identify communities (or clusters), 
4 - interpret clusters as real communities. 
Look at ground-truth, true latent clusters
Find networks with labels for clusters ahead of time:
Scientific collaborations: journals as research areas
Social networks: groups, lists
Information networks: topic based groups
A node can be a member of 0 or more group

"Guaranteed Learning of Latent Variable Models: Overlapping Community Models and Overcomplete Representations
Incorporating latent or hidden variables is a crucial aspect of statistical modeling. 
I will present a statistical and a computational framework for guaranteed learning of 
a wide range of latent variable models. I will focus on two instances, viz., 
community detection and overcomplete representations.
The goal of community detection is to discover hidden communities from graph data. 
I will present a tensor decomposition approach for learning probabilistic mixed membership models. 
The tensor approach is guaranteed to correctly recover the mixed membership communities with tight guarantees. 
We have deployed it on many real-world networks, e.g. Facebook, Yelp and DBLP. 
It is easily parallelizable, and is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-art stochastic variational approach."

Affiliation Network Models for Densely Overlapping Communities in Networks
Jure Leskovec, Stanford University

Networks are a general language for describing social, tech- nological and biological systems. 
Nodes in such networks organize into densely linked and overlapping clusters that correspond to 
communities in social networks, functionally related proteins in biological networks, or topically 
related webpages in information networks. Identifying such clusters is crucial to the understanding 
of the structural and func- tional roles of networks.

A.O.:
Community detection:
- Granovetter: small-worlds, strong & weak ties
- Girvan-Newman betweenness centrality

## 2 - Discovering individuals (profiling)

## 3 - Discovering propagation

3a: General propagation:

Using data about the propagation of the Higgs discovery to find populations as well as propagaion.
Source: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/higgs-twitter.html

1 - re-tweeting (retweet network)
2 - replying (reply network) to existing tweets
3 - mentioning (mention network) other users
4 - friends/followers social relationships among user involved in the above activities
5 - information about activity on Twitter during the discovery of Higgs boson


3b: Influencers:

To identify key actors, various centrality metrics can be computed based on a network’s structure 
- Degree (number of connections) 
- Betweenness (number of shortest paths an actor is on) 
- Closeness (relative distance to all other actors) 
- Eigenvector centrality (leading eigenvector of sociomatrix) 
One method for using these metrics to identify key actors is to plot actors’ scores for Eigenvector centrality 
versus Betweenness. 
Theoretically, these metrics should be approximately linear; therefore, any non-linear outliers will be of note. 
An actor with very high betweenness but low EC may be a critical gatekeeper to a central actor
Likewise, an actor with low betweenness but high EC may have unique access to central actors


Data/examples:

https://snap.stanford.edu/data/higgs-twitter.html

Test idea:
- grab 5-10 of biggest* news providers (NL) in twitter
- grab 1-2 neutral/fact based news providers (cbs/? see: e.g. www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/ 
  + https://twitter.com/FactTank)
- measure:
-- tweet frequency
-- followers
-- number of retweets
-- sentiment (general)
-- topic bias (1 - proportion of specific topics mentioned / not mentioned, 
   2 - bias in sentiment towards topiccs)
-- propagation (1 - centrality measures, 2 - reach, 3 - membership of ammount of clusters)




## 4 - Discovering most frequent topics + sentiment used by 1) communities, 2) individuals

- Use ABSA in relation to clusters, and individuals.



## 5 - Discovering overlap w/in 1-4
